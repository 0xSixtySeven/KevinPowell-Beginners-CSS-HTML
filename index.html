    </figure>

    <h2>FORMS</h2>
    <!-- We need a web form element to collect information from users. -->
    <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
        <input type="text" name="catphotourl" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    </form>
    <!-- ACTION ATTRIBUTE -->
    <!-- The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. For example, <form action="/submit-url"></form> tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the path /submit-url. -->

    <!-- INPUT ELEMENT -->
    <!-- The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. -->
    <!-- There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute. You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer. -->
    <!-- The type attribute on an input element creates different controls for the user to interact with. -->
    <!-- In this case we are using "radio", this will create a radio button. Radio buttons are used when you want to let the user select one of a limited number of choices. -->
    <!-- EXAMPLE IN THE CODE BELOW -->

    <!-- LABEL -->
    <!-- The label element is used to wrap the radio button and the text Indoor. -->
    <!-- This way the user can click on the text to select the radio button. -->
    <!-- With label the assign text will show in the text form and the radio button will be selected when the text is clicked. -->
    <label><input type="radio" id="indoor" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" id="outdoor" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
    <!-- This way it will allow the user to select both radio buttons. To fix this, we need to give each of the radio buttons a unique value for the name attribute. This way, when one is selected, the other will be unselected. -->

    <!-- VALUE ATTRIBUTE -->
    <!-- If you select the Indoor radio button and submit the form, the form data for the button is based on its name and value attributes. Since your radio buttons do not have a value attribute, the form data will include indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful when you have multiple buttons. -->
    <!-- The value attribute is used to define the value that should be submitted if the radio button is checked. -->
    <!-- EXAMPLE IN THE CODE ABOVE -->

    <!-- ID ATTRIBUTE -->
    <!-- EXAMPLE IS IN THE CODE ABOVE -->
    <!-- The id attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each id attribute's value must be unique from all other id values for the entire page. -->
    <!-- The id attribute is used to select and modify specific elements with CSS or JavaScript. -->

    <!-- NAME ATTRIBUTE -->
    <!-- In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted. For example, you could use the following syntax for an email address text field: <input type="text" name="email">. -->
    <!-- Add the name attribute with the value personality to the checkbox input element. -->
    <!-- While you won't notice this in the browser, doing this makes it easier for a server to process your web form,
    especially when there are multiple checkboxes. -->
    <input id="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> <label for="loving">Loving</label>

    <!-- PLACEHOLDER -->
    <!-- Placeholder text is used to give people a hint about what kind of information to enter into an input. For example,  -->

    <!-- REQUIRED ATTRIBUTE -->
    <!-- To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the required attribute to an input element. No need to put a value to required-->

    <!-- BUTTON ELEMENT with TYPE -->
    <!-- The button element is a simple way to add a clickable action to your web form. -->
    <!-- The button element can be used for other types of buttons, like a submit button, a reset button, or a button that does nothing when clicked. -->
    <!-- Add the type attribute with the value submit to the button to make it clear that it is a submit button. -->
    <button type="Submit">Submit</button>

    <!-- LEGEND ELEMENT -->
    <!-- The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form. -->
    <!-- APPLIED IN THE CODE BELOW -->

    <!-- FIELDSET ELEMENT -->
    <!-- The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line. -->
    <!-- This code will be duplicated with the code in LABEL, so we can see the difference when using the fieldset element. -->
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat?</legend>
        <label><input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="indoor"> Indoor</label>
        <label><input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" value="outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
    </fieldset>

    <!-- ANOTHER WAY TO USE INPUT ELEMENTS -->
    <!-- There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a label element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input element's id attribute. -->
    <fieldset>
        <legend>What's your cat's personality?</legend>
        <input id="loving" type="checkbox"> <label for="loving">Loving</label>
    </fieldset>

    <!-- DIVS AND SPANS -->
    <!-- Divs are used to create sections in the website. They are used to group elements together. They are block-level
    elements. -->
    <h2>DIVS AND SPANS</h2>
    <div>
        <p>This is <span class="span1">inside</span> a Div!</p>

    <!-- BOX MODEL CSS -->
    <!-- The box model is a model used to understand the design and layout of elements in a web page. -->
    <!-- The box model is made up of content, padding, border, and margin. -->

    <h2>CSS BOX MODEL</h2>

    <!-- This two boxes are explained in the stylesheet.css file. -->
